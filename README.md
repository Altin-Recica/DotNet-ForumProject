This is an extensive .NET study project that follows the development of a web application for managing users, messages, and replies. The project is built in multiple sprints, with each phase introducing new technologies and concepts. It starts with a C# console application and evolves into a full N-Layer application with an ASP.NET Core MVC frontend, a Web API, and database integration via Entity Framework. The focus is on demonstrating best practices, from architecture and validation to security with Identity and setting up a CI/CD pipeline.

## Sprints

* **Sprint 1:** Console application built with C# entities and basic functionality.
* **Sprint 2:** Project restructured into an N-Layer architecture with validation rules.
* **Sprint 3-4:** Data stored in a SQLite database via Entity Framework Core, including establishing relationships.
* **Sprint 5:** Web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC to display data and add new records.
* **Sprint 6:** REST API added for asynchronous data operations, driven by JavaScript.
* **Sprint 7:** User registration and login implemented with ASP.NET Core Identity, including roles.
* **Sprint 8:** Unit and integration tests written and a CI/CD pipeline set up via GitLab.
